##Deployed-Link
## Introduction
- The goal of this project is to create a tool for new players coming into a game called 'League of Legends' and help them find a character that sounds interesting for them. Using my knowledge of React and Javascript, I have managed to create an app that does just that.

## Technologies
- React
- JavaScript
- Cypress
- Router
- HTML
- CSS

## Features
- Filter champions by a 'tag' that determines their playstyle
- Click on a champion card to see more information about the champion.

## Possible Future Extentsions
- Using another api to display the champions abilites when a user clicks on their card
- Display more personal information about the champion (brief lore summary) on the champions card.
